# Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our project! Here are some links to help you get started:

- [Quick start guide](./docs/quick-start.md)
- [Development guide](./docs/development.md)
- [Project design outline](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220712-cluster-api-addon-orchestration.md)

## âœ¨ What is Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm?

Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm is a Cluster API provider that extends the functionality of Cluster API by providing a solution for managing the installation, configuration, upgrade, and deletion of Cluster add-ons using Helm charts. This project is based on the [Cluster API Add-on Orchestration Proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220712-cluster-api-addon-orchestration.md)] and is part of an larger, ongoing effort to bring add-ons orchestration to Cluster API using existing package management tools. 

This is a concrete implementation of a ClusterAddonProvider, a new pluggable component to be deployed on the Management Cluster. A ClusterAddonProvider must be implemented using a specified package management tool and will act as an intermediary/proxy between Cluster API and the chosen package management solution. As such, Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm is the first concrete implementation and can serve as a reference implementation for ClusterAddonProviders using other package managers.

The aims of the ClusterAddonProvider project are as follows:

#### Goals

- To design a solution for orchestrating Cluster add-ons.
- To leverage existing package management tools such as Helm for all the foundational capabilities of add-on management, i.e. add-on packages/repository, templating/configuration, add-on creation, upgrade and deletion etc. 
- To make add-on management in Cluster API modular and pluggable, and to make it simple for developers to build a Cluster API Add-on Provider based on any package management tool, just like with infrastructure and bootstrap providers.

#### Non goals

- To implement a full fledged package management tool in Cluster API; there are already several awesome package management tools in the ecosystem, and CAPI should not reinvent the wheel. 
- To provide a mechanism for altering, customizing, or dealing with single Kubernetes resources defining a Cluster add-on, i.e. Deployments, Services, ServiceAccounts. Cluster API should treat add-ons as opaque components and delegate all the operations impacting add-on internals to the package management tool.
- To expect users to use a specific package management tool.
- To implement a solution for installing add-ons on the management cluster itself.

## ðŸ¤— Community, discussion, contribution, and support

Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm is developed as a part of the [Cluster API project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api). As such, it will share the same communication channels and meeting as Cluster API.
